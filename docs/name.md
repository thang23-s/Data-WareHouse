**General Principles**

-**Naming Conventions** :lowercase letters with underscores (_).
- **Language** : Use English for all names.
- **Avoid Reserverd Words** :Do not use SQL reserved words as object names.
  
**Tables Naming Conventions**

**Bronze Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Silver Rules**
- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- **`<sourcesystem>_<entity>`**  
  - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm`, `erp`).  
  - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.  
  - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

### **Gold Rules**
- All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
- **`<category>_<entity>`**  
  - `<category>`: Describes the role of the table, such as `dim` (dimension) or `fact` (fact table).  
  - `<entity>`: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `sales`).  
  - Examples:
    - `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data.  
    - `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions.  

#### **Glossary of Category Patterns**

| Pattern     | Meaning                           | Example(s)                              |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `dim_`      | Dimension table                  | `dim_customer`, `dim_product`           |
| `fact_`     | Fact table                       | `fact_sales`                            |
| `report_`   | Report table                     | `report_customers`, `report_sales_monthly`   |

## **Column Naming Conventions**

### **Surrogate Keys**  
- All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix `_key`.
- **`<table_name>_key`**  
  - `<table_name>`: Refers to the name of the table or entity the key belongs to.  
  - `_key`: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.  
  - Example: `customer_key` → Surrogate key in the `dim_customers` table.
  
### **Technical Columns**
- All technical columns must start with the prefix `dwh_`, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.
- **`dwh_<column_name>`**  
  - `dwh`: Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.  
  - `<column_name>`: Descriptive name indicating the column's purpose.  
  - Example: `dwh_load_date` → System-generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded.
 
## **Stored Procedure**

- All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern:
- **`load_<layer>`**.
  
  - `<layer>`: Represents the layer being loaded, such as `bronze`, `silver`, or `gold`.
  - Example: 
    - `load_bronze` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze layer.
    - `load_silver` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver layer.
